Smart Tagging

 Found an interesting point in a video? On Clip Mine, adding tags is not reserved for the video owners only - any community member can do it. In addition our smart algorithms can automatically suggest tags (in
private beta) for a wide variety of videos!


Benefits
Personalized Experience ClipMine allows your viewers to the video content and see what's inside, through it, and specific parts of the videos they like.
Improved Engagement Our customers have seen up to 50% higher engagement and lower early drop-off rates on their videos when embedded with ClipMine

Actionable Analytics
Our in-video analytics (by invitation only) allow you to understand user engagement in terms of your content rather than timestamps. You'll exactly know which parts of the video are more likely to be clicked and how long users stay there.
